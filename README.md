# Language-Parser

A fun little language parser. Currently not functional. 

### Commands
- `$/exit` to leave the program.
- `$/run` to execute your script. Adding a path like so `$/run @D:\\user\\scripts\\test.txt` will run the script within that file.
- `$/clear` to clear your script and the console.
